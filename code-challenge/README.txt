[DESCRIPTION]
Java 6 implementation of a Single Linked List data structure.
Maven based.


[REQUIREMENTS]
 * JDK 6 or better
 * Maven 3 or better


[ASSIGNMENT]
Implement singly-linked list with recursive and iterative reverse
operations.

You must provide:

1. An iterative reverse.

2. A recursive reverse.

3. A full suite of automated tests.


[WHERE TO LOOK FOR THE SOLUTION]
The singly-linked list itself is implemented in src/main/java/net/uvavru/amazon/SingleLinkedList.java
The iterative and recursive reverse operations are declared in an interface src/main/java/net/uvavru/amazon/AmazonAssignment.java
Automated tests are located in folder src/test/java/net/uvavru/amazon (run from maven)


[HOW TO USE THIS]
Build this by running 'mvn install'
Use this as a library in any JVM based project of your choice.
